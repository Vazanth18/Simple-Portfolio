            <p class="section-two__desc">Hi, I'm Vasanth. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSc IT) from VLB Janakiammal Arts and Science College in 2020. My journey in the IT field started even before college, as I began working part-time at Krishtech Computers. This early experience sparked my interest in technology and helped me build a solid foundation in computer systems.After completing my degree, I continued working with Krishtech Computers and took on the role of a System Administrator. I've been working in this capacity ever since, gaining hands-on experience in managing and maintaining computer networks, troubleshooting system issues, and ensuring seamless IT operations.I am passionate about technology and enjoy finding solutions to technical challenges. Over the years, I've developed a strong skill set in system administration, and I'm always eager to learn more and improve my expertise.
