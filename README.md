# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. Built using only HTML and basic CSS, it serves as a simple yet effective representation of my work and capabilities.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Includes an introduction and an overview of my background and skills.
- **Contact Page**: Provides an easy way to find my contact details for potential collaborations or inquiries.

## Technologies Used
